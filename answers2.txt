1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

   folders from a project that Git should ignore. It should include .var, .jar, .class files
   in a java project.

2.What does fast-forward in git mean? 

-->Fast forward in git means forwarding the current commit reference of the branch.
  When our changes are pushed git then searches for a path from the current reference 
  to target commit reference.

3. Why should you have different branches? 

-->If we have multiple branches we can commit our test changes in that particular barnch 
without disturbing main branch and the main advantage is multiple people can work parallely on
different branches at the same time.
